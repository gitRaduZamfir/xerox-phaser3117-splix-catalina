## 🚀 Choose Your Installation Method

Depending on your comfort level with the Terminal, choose one of the two methods below:

### 1. Script-Based Installation (Recommended)
This is the **fastest and easiest** method. It uses a script to automate the file permissions, driver paths, and printer registration.

👉 **[Follow SCRIPT-INSTALL.md instructions](./SCRIPT-INSTALL.md)**

### 2. Manual Installation
Choose this method if you prefer to perform each step yourself or if you want to understand exactly how the driver is being configured on your system.

👉 **[Follow INSTALL.md instructions](./INSTALL.md)**

## 🛠 Prerequisites
Regardless of the method you choose, ensure you have:
* A **USB connection** to the printer.
